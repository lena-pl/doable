== README

Doable is a simple "To Do" App I'm building to learn a bit more about Ruby on Rails.

MVP Features:
- Register as a user and log in
- Create lists associated to the logged in user
- Create tasks associated to the logged in user and one of their lists
- "Complete" tasks on the user's lists

Extra Features:
- Add other users to lists, so they can add and complete tasks
